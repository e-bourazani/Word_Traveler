These will be your target locations. \nYour partner is a local and you should cooperate with them to navigate the city. You must give them clues about where you want to travel and they have to guess the location correctly.\nYou have to plan out a route on the map based on the target location list and provide an answer with directions.\nRegular target locations give you 1 point each and special target locations give you 2 points. Your goal is to maximize your team score. You only score points for the locations you land on.\nYou only have one round to describe all possible movements and use the available adjectives as clues.\n\nRules for the Traveler: \n\n1. Provide an answer for your planned journey only in the following format, without any additional text:\n\n    Direction: cardinal direction you want your partner to follow\n    Clues: adjectives to describe one location\n    Destination: location name of your intended destination\n\nTo indicate where your intended destination lies on the map, you should use one of the cardinal directions.\nThe cardinal directions are: ('North', 'South', 'East', 'West')\n\n\"North\" indicates increasing the y-axis,\n\"South\" indicates decreasing the y-axis, \n\"East\" indicate increasing the x-axis,\n“West\" indicates decreasing the x-axis\n\nIf you have to visit 3 locations, your first movement should include all three parts, i.e. Direction, Clues, Destination and that should be the case for any following locations, too. \nAdditionally, if you visit more than one locations, you must number the directions that form the planned path.\nThe following is an example of how your answer should look like in the case you have to visit 2 locations:\n\n    Direction 1: West\n    Clues: tall, luminous\n    Destination: The Statue of Liberty\n\n    Direction 2: South\n    Clues: tasty, not bitter\n    Destination: Cannoli\n\n2. Your directions have to refer to exactly one set of coordinates in the map.\n3. You can use as many adjectives from the wordlist as you need to describe each target location. \n4. You can only use an adjective once.\n5. You must provide at least one adjective per movement. \n6. You can modify adjectives by adding “ not ” before them. (Example: “funny” or “not funny” are both valid answers.)\n7. You can only move in straight lines, horizontally or vertically, as many spaces as you want. (Example: from location (2,2) you can move to locations (2,1), (2,3), (4,2) or (1,2), etc). \n8. You cannot exceed the limits of the map or travel to non-existing locations. \n9.

These will be your target locations. \nYour partner is a local and you should cooperate with them to navigate the city. You must give them clues about where you want to travel and they have to guess the location correctly.\nYou have to plan out a route on the map based on the target location list and provide an answer with directions.\nRegular target locations give you 1 point each and special target locations give you 2 points. Your goal is to maximize your team score. You only score points for the locations you land on.\nYou only have one round to describe all possible movements and use the available adjectives as clues.\n\nRules for the Traveler: \n\n1. Provide an answer for your planned journey only in the following format, without any additional text:\n\n    Direction: cardinal direction you want your partner to follow\n    Clues: adjectives to describe one location\n    Destination: location name of your intended destination\n\nTo indicate where your intended destination lies on the map, you should use one of the cardinal directions.\nThe cardinal directions are: ('North', 'South', 'East', 'West')\n\n\"North\" indicates increasing the y-axis,\n\"South\" indicates decreasing the y-axis, \n\"East\" indicate increasing the x-axis,\n“West\" indicates decreasing the x-axis\n\nIf you have to visit 3 locations, your first movement should include all three parts, i.e. Direction, Clues, Destination and that should be the case for any following locations, too. \nAdditionally, if you visit more than one locations, you must number the directions that form the planned path.\nThe following is an example of how your answer should look like in the case you have to visit 2 locations:\n\n    Direction 1: West\n    Clues: tall, luminous\n    Destination: The Statue of Liberty\n\n    Direction 2: South\n    Clues: tasty, not bitter\n    Destination: Cannoli\n\n2.

You can only use an adjective once.\n5. You must provide at least one adjective per movement. \n6. You can modify adjectives by adding “ not ” before them. (Example: “funny” or “not funny” are both valid answers.)\n7. You can only move in straight lines, horizontally or vertically, as many spaces as you want.

These will be your target locations. \nYour partner is a local and you should cooperate with them to navigate the city. You must give them clues about where you want to travel and they have to guess the location correctly.\nYou have to plan out a route on the map based on the target location list and provide an answer with directions.\nRegular target locations give you 1 point each and special target locations give you 2 points. Your goal is to maximize your team score. You only score points for the locations you land on.\nYou only have one round to describe all possible movements and use the available adjectives as clues.\n\nRules for the Traveler: \n\n1. Provide an answer for your planned journey only in the following format, without any additional text:\n\n    Direction: cardinal direction you want your partner to follow\n    Clues: adjectives to describe one location\n    Destination: location name of your intended destination\n\nTo indicate where your intended destination lies on the map, you should use one of the cardinal directions.\nThe cardinal directions are: ('North', 'South', 'East', 'West')\n\n\"North\" indicates increasing the y-axis,\n\"South\" indicates decreasing the y-axis, \n\"East\" indicate increasing the x-axis,\n“West\" indicates decreasing the x-axis\n\nIf you have to visit 3 locations, your first movement should include all three parts, i.e. Direction, Clues, Destination and that should be the case for any following locations, too. \nAdditionally, if you visit more than one locations, you must number the directions that form the planned path.\nThe following is an example of how your answer should look like in the case you have to visit 2 locations:\n\n    Direction 1: West\n    Clues: tall, luminous\n    Destination: The Statue of Liberty\n\n    Direction 2: South\n    Clues: tasty, not bitter\n    Destination: Cannoli\n\n2. Your directions have to refer to exactly one set of coordinates in the map.\n3. You can use as many adjectives from the wordlist as you need to describe each target location. \n4. You can only use an adjective once.\n5. You must provide at least one adjective per movement. \n6. You can modify adjectives by adding “ not ” before them. (Example: “funny” or “not funny” are both valid answers.)\n7. You can only move in straight lines, horizontally or vertically, as many spaces as you want. (Example: from location (2,2) you can move to locations (2,1), (2,3), (4,2) or (1,2), etc). \n8. You cannot exceed the limits of the map or travel to non-existing locations. \n9.

These will be your target locations. \nYour partner is a local and you should cooperate with them to navigate the city. You must give them clues about where you want to travel and they have to guess the location correctly.\nYou have to plan out a route on the map based on the target location list and provide an answer with directions.\nRegular target locations give you 1 point each and special target locations give you 2 points. Your goal is to maximize your team score. You only score points for the locations you land on.\nYou only have one round to describe all possible movements and use the available adjectives as clues.\n\nRules for the Traveler: \n\n1. Provide an answer for your planned journey only in the following format, without any additional text:\n\n    Direction: cardinal direction you want your partner to follow\n    Clues: adjectives to describe one location\n    Destination: location name of your intended destination\n\nTo indicate where your intended destination lies on the map, you should use one of the cardinal directions.\nThe cardinal directions are: ('North', 'South', 'East', 'West')\n\n\"North\" indicates increasing the y-axis,\n\"South\" indicates decreasing the y-axis, \n\"East\" indicate increasing the x-axis,\n“West\" indicates decreasing the x-axis\n\nIf you have to visit 3 locations, your first movement should include all three parts, i.e. Direction, Clues, Destination and that should be the case for any following locations, too. \nAdditionally, if you visit more than one locations, you must number the directions that form the planned path.\nThe following is an example of how your answer should look like in the case you have to visit 2 locations:\n\n    Direction 1: West\n    Clues: tall, luminous\n    Destination: The Statue of Liberty\n\n    Direction 2: South\n    Clues: tasty, not bitter\n    Destination: Cannoli\n\n2. Your directions have to refer to exactly one set of coordinates in the map.\n3. You can use as many adjectives from the wordlist as you need to describe each target location. \n4. You can only use an adjective once.\n5. You must provide at least one adjective per movement. \n6. You can modify adjectives by adding “ not ” before them. (Example: “funny” or “not funny” are both valid answers.)\n7. You can only move in straight lines, horizontally or vertically, as many spaces as you want. (Example: from location (2,2) you can move to locations (2,1), (2,3), (4,2) or (1,2), etc). \n8. You cannot exceed the limits of the map or travel to non-existing locations. \n9.

These will be your target locations. \nYour partner is a local and you should cooperate with them to navigate the city. You must give them clues about where you want to travel and they have to guess the location correctly.\nYou have to plan out a route on the map based on the target location list and provide an answer with directions.\nRegular target locations give you 1 point each and special target locations give you 2 points. Your goal is to maximize your team score. You only score points for the locations you land on.\nYou only have one round to describe all possible movements and use the available adjectives as clues.\n\nRules for the Traveler: \n\n1. Provide an answer for your planned journey only in the following format, without any additional text:\n\n    Direction: cardinal direction you want your partner to follow\n    Clues: adjectives to describe one location\n    Destination: location name of your intended destination\n\nTo indicate where your intended destination lies on the map, you should use one of the cardinal directions.\nThe cardinal directions are: ('North', 'South', 'East', 'West')\n\n\"North\" indicates increasing the y-axis,\n\"South\" indicates decreasing the y-axis, \n\"East\" indicate increasing the x-axis,\n“West\" indicates decreasing the x-axis\n\nIf you have to visit 3 locations, your first movement should include all three parts, i.e. Direction, Clues, Destination and that should be the case for any following locations, too. \nAdditionally, if you visit more than one locations, you must number the directions that form the planned path.\nThe following is an example of how your answer should look like in the case you have to visit 2 locations:\n\n    Direction 1: West\n    Clues: tall, luminous\n    Destination: The Statue of Liberty\n\n    Direction 2: South\n    Clues: tasty, not bitter\n    Destination: Cannoli\n\n2.

You can only use an adjective once.\n5. You must provide at least one adjective per movement. \n6. You can modify adjectives by adding “ not ” before them. (Example: “funny” or “not funny” are both valid answers.)\n7. You can only move in straight lines, horizontally or vertically, as many spaces as you want. (Example: from location (2,2) you can move to locations (2,1), (2,3), (4,2) or (1,2), etc). \n8. You cannot exceed the limits of the map or travel to non-existing locations. \n9. You must provide all your movements at once.\n\nFor this game:\n\n* The city you are visiting is: Madrid\n\n* The city map is: \n(0, 0): Royal Palace\n(1, 0): Plaza Mayor\n(2, 0): Churro Cone\n(3, 0): Gran Vía Sign\n(4, 0): Retiro Pond\n(0, 1): Puerta del Sol Clock\n(1, 1): Bear and Strawberry Tree Statue\n(2, 1): Plate of Jamón\n(3, 1): Bull Statue\n(4, 1): Fountain\n(0, 2): Prado Museum\n(1, 2): Flamenco Fan\n(2, 2): Beer Glass\n(3, 2): Paella Pan\n(4, 2): Street Lamp\n(0, 3): Crystal Palace\n(1, 3): Azulejo Wall\n(2, 3): Tapas Plate\n(3, 3): Botanical Garden Gate\n(4, 3): Roman Columns\n(0, 4): Almudena Cathedral\n(1, 4): Viaduct\n(2, 4): Street Performer\n(3, 4): Café Terrace\n(4, 4): Courtyard Well\n\n* In total you have 1 movement(s). \n(If you have one movement, you can visit one location only and must give one set of directions. If you have two movements, you can visit only two location and must give two sets, and if you have three movements, you can visit three locations and must give three sets.)\n\n* Your starting location is (1, 0): Plaza Mayor\n\n* Your locations of interest are:\n(3, 3): Botanical Garden Gate\n(4, 1): Fountain\n(0, 0): Royal Palace\n(1, 0): Plaza Mayor\n(2, 3): Tapas Plate\n(1, 1): Bear and Strawberry Tree Statue\n\n* Your special locations of interest are:\n(4, 0): Retiro Pond\n(0, 4): Almudena Cathedral\n(4, 2): Street Lamp\n\n* Your list of adjectives to use as clues is:  \n['confusing', 'authentic', 'crafted', 'dirty', 'alien', 'classic', 'salty', 'charming', 'rich', 'active']",

These will be your target locations. \nYour partner is a local and you should cooperate with them to navigate the city. You must give them clues about where you want to travel and they have to guess the location correctly.\nYou have to plan out a route on the map based on the target location list and provide an answer with directions.\nRegular target locations give you 1 point each and special target locations give you 2 points. Your goal is to maximize your team score. You only score points for the locations you land on.\nYou only have one round to describe all possible movements and use the available adjectives as clues.\n\nRules for the Traveler: \n\n1.

You can only use an adjective once.\n5. You must provide at least one adjective per movement. \n6. You can modify adjectives by adding “ not ” before them. (Example: “funny” or “not funny” are both valid answers.)\n7. You can only move in straight lines, horizontally or vertically, as many spaces as you want.

Your goal is to maximize your team score. You only score points for the locations you land on.\nYou only have one round to describe all possible movements and use the available adjectives as clues.\n\nRules for the Traveler: \n\n1.

These will be your target locations. \nYour partner is a local and you should cooperate with them to navigate the city. You must give them clues about where you want to travel and they have to guess the location correctly.\nYou have to plan out a route on the map based on the target location list and provide an answer with directions.\nRegular target locations give you 1 point each and special target locations give you 2 points. Your goal is to maximize your team score. You only score points for the locations you land on.\nYou only have one round to describe all possible movements and use the available adjectives as clues.\n\nRules for the Traveler: \n\n1. Provide an answer for your planned journey only in the following format, without any additional text:\n\n    Direction: cardinal direction you want your partner to follow\n    Clues: adjectives to describe one location\n    Destination: location name of your intended destination\n\nTo indicate where your intended destination lies on the map, you should use one of the cardinal directions.\nThe cardinal directions are: ('North', 'South', 'East', 'West')\n\n\"North\" indicates increasing the y-axis,\n\"South\" indicates decreasing the y-axis, \n\"East\" indicate increasing the x-axis,\n“West\" indicates decreasing the x-axis\n\nIf you have to visit 3 locations, your first movement should include all three parts, i.e. Direction, Clues, Destination and that should be the case for any following locations, too. \nAdditionally, if you visit more than one locations, you must number the directions that form the planned path.\nThe following is an example of how your answer should look like in the case you have to visit 2 locations:\n\n    Direction 1: West\n    Clues: tall, luminous\n    Destination: The Statue of Liberty\n\n    Direction 2: South\n    Clues: tasty, not bitter\n    Destination: Cannoli\n\n2. Your directions have to refer to exactly one set of coordinates in the map.\n3. You can use as many adjectives from the wordlist as you need to describe each target location. \n4. You can only use an adjective once.\n5. You must provide at least one adjective per movement. \n6. You can modify adjectives by adding “ not ” before them. (Example: “funny” or “not funny” are both valid answers.)\n7. You can only move in straight lines, horizontally or vertically, as many spaces as you want. (Example: from location (2,2) you can move to locations (2,1), (2,3), (4,2) or (1,2), etc). \n8. You cannot exceed the limits of the map or travel to non-existing locations. \n9.

These will be your target locations. \nYour partner is a local and you should cooperate with them to navigate the city. You must give them clues about where you want to travel and they have to guess the location correctly.\nYou have to plan out a route on the map based on the target location list and provide an answer with directions.\nRegular target locations give you 1 point each and special target locations give you 2 points. Your goal is to maximize your team score. You only score points for the locations you land on.\nYou only have one round to describe all possible movements and use the available adjectives as clues.\n\nRules for the Traveler: \n\n1. Provide an answer for your planned journey only in the following format, without any additional text:\n\n    Direction: cardinal direction you want your partner to follow\n    Clues: adjectives to describe one location\n    Destination: location name of your intended destination\n\nTo indicate where your intended destination lies on the map, you should use one of the cardinal directions.\nThe cardinal directions are: ('North', 'South', 'East', 'West')\n\n\"North\" indicates increasing the y-axis,\n\"South\" indicates decreasing the y-axis, \n\"East\" indicate increasing the x-axis,\n“West\" indicates decreasing the x-axis\n\nIf you have to visit 3 locations, your first movement should include all three parts, i.e. Direction, Clues, Destination and that should be the case for any following locations, too. \nAdditionally, if you visit more than one locations, you must number the directions that form the planned path.\nThe following is an example of how your answer should look like in the case you have to visit 2 locations:\n\n    Direction 1: West\n    Clues: tall, luminous\n    Destination: The Statue of Liberty\n\n    Direction 2: South\n    Clues: tasty, not bitter\n    Destination: Cannoli\n\n2. Your directions have to refer to exactly one set of coordinates in the map.\n3. You can use as many adjectives from the wordlist as you need to describe each target location. \n4. You can only use an adjective once.\n5. You must provide at least one adjective per movement. \n6. You can modify adjectives by adding “ not ” before them. (Example: “funny” or “not funny” are both valid answers.)\n7. You can only move in straight lines, horizontally or vertically, as many spaces as you want. (Example: from location (2,2) you can move to locations (2,1), (2,3), (4,2) or (1,2), etc). \n8. You cannot exceed the limits of the map or travel to non-existing locations. \n9.

Your goal is to maximize your team score. You only score points for the locations you land on.\nYou only have one round to describe all possible movements and use the available adjectives as clues.\n\nRules for the Traveler: \n\n1. Provide an answer for your planned journey only in the following format, without any additional text:\n\n    Direction: cardinal direction you want your partner to follow\n    Clues: adjectives to describe one location\n    Destination: location name of your intended destination\n\nTo indicate where your intended destination lies on the map, you should use one of the cardinal directions.\nThe cardinal directions are: ('North', 'South', 'East', 'West')\n\n\"North\" indicates increasing the y-axis,\n\"South\" indicates decreasing the y-axis, \n\"East\" indicate increasing the x-axis,\n“West\" indicates decreasing the x-axis\n\nIf you have to visit 3 locations, your first movement should include all three parts, i.e. Direction, Clues, Destination and that should be the case for any following locations, too. \nAdditionally, if you visit more than one locations, you must number the directions that form the planned path.\nThe following is an example of how your answer should look like in the case you have to visit 2 locations:\n\n    Direction 1: West\n    Clues: tall, luminous\n    Destination: The Statue of Liberty\n\n    Direction 2: South\n    Clues: tasty, not bitter\n    Destination: Cannoli\n\n2.

These will be your target locations. \nYour partner is a local and you should cooperate with them to navigate the city. You must give them clues about where you want to travel and they have to guess the location correctly.\nYou have to plan out a route on the map based on the target location list and provide an answer with directions.\nRegular target locations give you 1 point each and special target locations give you 2 points. Your goal is to maximize your team score. You only score points for the locations you land on.\nYou only have one round to describe all possible movements and use the available adjectives as clues.\n\nRules for the Traveler: \n\n1. Provide an answer for your planned journey only in the following format, without any additional text:\n\n    Direction: cardinal direction you want your partner to follow\n    Clues: adjectives to describe one location\n    Destination: location name of your intended destination\n\nTo indicate where your intended destination lies on the map, you should use one of the cardinal directions.\nThe cardinal directions are: ('North', 'South', 'East', 'West')\n\n\"North\" indicates increasing the y-axis,\n\"South\" indicates decreasing the y-axis, \n\"East\" indicate increasing the x-axis,\n“West\" indicates decreasing the x-axis\n\nIf you have to visit 3 locations, your first movement should include all three parts, i.e. Direction, Clues, Destination and that should be the case for any following locations, too. \nAdditionally, if you visit more than one locations, you must number the directions that form the planned path.\nThe following is an example of how your answer should look like in the case you have to visit 2 locations:\n\n    Direction 1: West\n    Clues: tall, luminous\n    Destination: The Statue of Liberty\n\n    Direction 2: South\n    Clues: tasty, not bitter\n    Destination: Cannoli\n\n2.

You can only use an adjective once.\n5. You must provide at least one adjective per movement. \n6. You can modify adjectives by adding “ not ” before them. (Example: “funny” or “not funny” are both valid answers.)\n7. You can only move in straight lines, horizontally or vertically, as many spaces as you want.

These will be your target locations. \nYour partner is a local and you should cooperate with them to navigate the city. You must give them clues about where you want to travel and they have to guess the location correctly.\nYou have to plan out a route on the map based on the target location list and provide an answer with directions.\nRegular target locations give you 1 point each and special target locations give you 2 points. Your goal is to maximize your team score. You only score points for the locations you land on.\nYou only have one round to describe all possible movements and use the available adjectives as clues.\n\nRules for the Traveler: \n\n1. Provide an answer for your planned journey only in the following format, without any additional text:\n\n    Direction: cardinal direction you want your partner to follow\n    Clues: adjectives to describe one location\n    Destination: location name of your intended destination\n\nTo indicate where your intended destination lies on the map, you should use one of the cardinal directions.\nThe cardinal directions are: ('North', 'South', 'East', 'West')\n\n\"North\" indicates increasing the y-axis,\n\"South\" indicates decreasing the y-axis, \n\"East\" indicate increasing the x-axis,\n“West\" indicates decreasing the x-axis\n\nIf you have to visit 3 locations, your first movement should include all three parts, i.e. Direction, Clues, Destination and that should be the case for any following locations, too. \nAdditionally, if you visit more than one locations, you must number the directions that form the planned path.\nThe following is an example of how your answer should look like in the case you have to visit 2 locations:\n\n    Direction 1: West\n    Clues: tall, luminous\n    Destination: The Statue of Liberty\n\n    Direction 2: South\n    Clues: tasty, not bitter\n    Destination: Cannoli\n\n2. Your directions have to refer to exactly one set of coordinates in the map.\n3. You can use as many adjectives from the wordlist as you need to describe each target location. \n4. You can only use an adjective once.\n5. You must provide at least one adjective per movement. \n6. You can modify adjectives by adding “ not ” before them. (Example: “funny” or “not funny” are both valid answers.)\n7. You can only move in straight lines, horizontally or vertically, as many spaces as you want. (Example: from location (2,2) you can move to locations (2,1), (2,3), (4,2) or (1,2), etc). \n8. You cannot exceed the limits of the map or travel to non-existing locations. \n9.

These will be your target locations. \nYour partner is a local and you should cooperate with them to navigate the city. You must give them clues about where you want to travel and they have to guess the location correctly.\nYou have to plan out a route on the map based on the target location list and provide an answer with directions.\nRegular target locations give you 1 point each and special target locations give you 2 points. Your goal is to maximize your team score. You only score points for the locations you land on.\nYou only have one round to describe all possible movements and use the available adjectives as clues.\n\nRules for the Traveler: \n\n1. Provide an answer for your planned journey only in the following format, without any additional text:\n\n    Direction: cardinal direction you want your partner to follow\n    Clues: adjectives to describe one location\n    Destination: location name of your intended destination\n\nTo indicate where your intended destination lies on the map, you should use one of the cardinal directions.\nThe cardinal directions are: ('North', 'South', 'East', 'West')\n\n\"North\" indicates increasing the y-axis,\n\"South\" indicates decreasing the y-axis, \n\"East\" indicate increasing the x-axis,\n“West\" indicates decreasing the x-axis\n\nIf you have to visit 3 locations, your first movement should include all three parts, i.e. Direction, Clues, Destination and that should be the case for any following locations, too. \nAdditionally, if you visit more than one locations, you must number the directions that form the planned path.\nThe following is an example of how your answer should look like in the case you have to visit 2 locations:\n\n    Direction 1: West\n    Clues: tall, luminous\n    Destination: The Statue of Liberty\n\n    Direction 2: South\n    Clues: tasty, not bitter\n    Destination: Cannoli\n\n2. Your directions have to refer to exactly one set of coordinates in the map.\n3. You can use as many adjectives from the wordlist as you need to describe each target location. \n4. You can only use an adjective once.\n5. You must provide at least one adjective per movement. \n6. You can modify adjectives by adding “ not ” before them. (Example: “funny” or “not funny” are both valid answers.)\n7. You can only move in straight lines, horizontally or vertically, as many spaces as you want. (Example: from location (2,2) you can move to locations (2,1), (2,3), (4,2) or (1,2), etc). \n8. You cannot exceed the limits of the map or travel to non-existing locations. \n9.

These will be your target locations. \nYour partner is a local and you should cooperate with them to navigate the city. You must give them clues about where you want to travel and they have to guess the location correctly.\nYou have to plan out a route on the map based on the target location list and provide an answer with directions.\nRegular target locations give you 1 point each and special target locations give you 2 points. Your goal is to maximize your team score. You only score points for the locations you land on.\nYou only have one round to describe all possible movements and use the available adjectives as clues.\n\nRules for the Traveler: \n\n1.

These will be your target locations. \nYour partner is a local and you should cooperate with them to navigate the city. You must give them clues about where you want to travel and they have to guess the location correctly.\nYou have to plan out a route on the map based on the target location list and provide an answer with directions.\nRegular target locations give you 1 point each and special target locations give you 2 points. Your goal is to maximize your team score. You only score points for the locations you land on.\nYou only have one round to describe all possible movements and use the available adjectives as clues.\n\nRules for the Traveler: \n\n1. Provide an answer for your planned journey only in the following format, without any additional text:\n\n    Direction: cardinal direction you want your partner to follow\n    Clues: adjectives to describe one location\n    Destination: location name of your intended destination\n\nTo indicate where your intended destination lies on the map, you should use one of the cardinal directions.\nThe cardinal directions are: ('North', 'South', 'East', 'West')\n\n\"North\" indicates increasing the y-axis,\n\"South\" indicates decreasing the y-axis, \n\"East\" indicate increasing the x-axis,\n“West\" indicates decreasing the x-axis\n\nIf you have to visit 3 locations, your first movement should include all three parts, i.e. Direction, Clues, Destination and that should be the case for any following locations, too. \nAdditionally, if you visit more than one locations, you must number the directions that form the planned path.\nThe following is an example of how your answer should look like in the case you have to visit 2 locations:\n\n    Direction 1: West\n    Clues: tall, luminous\n    Destination: The Statue of Liberty\n\n    Direction 2: South\n    Clues: tasty, not bitter\n    Destination: Cannoli\n\n2.

These will be your target locations. \nYour partner is a local and you should cooperate with them to navigate the city. You must give them clues about where you want to travel and they have to guess the location correctly.\nYou have to plan out a route on the map based on the target location list and provide an answer with directions.\nRegular target locations give you 1 point each and special target locations give you 2 points. Your goal is to maximize your team score. You only score points for the locations you land on.\nYou only have one round to describe all possible movements and use the available adjectives as clues.\n\nRules for the Traveler: \n\n1.

You can only use an adjective once.\n5. You must provide at least one adjective per movement. \n6. You can modify adjectives by adding “ not ” before them. (Example: “funny” or “not funny” are both valid answers.)\n7. You can only move in straight lines, horizontally or vertically, as many spaces as you want.

These will be your target locations. \nYour partner is a local and you should cooperate with them to navigate the city. You must give them clues about where you want to travel and they have to guess the location correctly.\nYou have to plan out a route on the map based on the target location list and provide an answer with directions.\nRegular target locations give you 1 point each and special target locations give you 2 points. Your goal is to maximize your team score. You only score points for the locations you land on.\nYou only have one round to describe all possible movements and use the available adjectives as clues.\n\nRules for the Traveler: \n\n1. Provide an answer for your planned journey only in the following format, without any additional text:\n\n    Direction: cardinal direction you want your partner to follow\n    Clues: adjectives to describe one location\n    Destination: location name of your intended destination\n\nTo indicate where your intended destination lies on the map, you should use one of the cardinal directions.\nThe cardinal directions are: ('North', 'South', 'East', 'West')\n\n\"North\" indicates increasing the y-axis,\n\"South\" indicates decreasing the y-axis, \n\"East\" indicate increasing the x-axis,\n“West\" indicates decreasing the x-axis\n\nIf you have to visit 3 locations, your first movement should include all three parts, i.e. Direction, Clues, Destination and that should be the case for any following locations, too. \nAdditionally, if you visit more than one locations, you must number the directions that form the planned path.\nThe following is an example of how your answer should look like in the case you have to visit 2 locations:\n\n    Direction 1: West\n    Clues: tall, luminous\n    Destination: The Statue of Liberty\n\n    Direction 2: South\n    Clues: tasty, not bitter\n    Destination: Cannoli\n\n2. Your directions have to refer to exactly one set of coordinates in the map.\n3. You can use as many adjectives from the wordlist as you need to describe each target location. \n4. You can only use an adjective once.\n5. You must provide at least one adjective per movement. \n6. You can modify adjectives by adding “ not ” before them. (Example: “funny” or “not funny” are both valid answers.)\n7. You can only move in straight lines, horizontally or vertically, as many spaces as you want.

Provide an answer for your planned journey only in the following format, without any additional text:\n\n    Direction: cardinal direction you want your partner to follow\n    Clues: adjectives to describe one location\n    Destination: location name of your intended destination\n\nTo indicate where your intended destination lies on the map, you should use one of the cardinal directions.\nThe cardinal directions are: ('North', 'South', 'East', 'West')\n\n\"North\" indicates increasing the y-axis,\n\"South\" indicates decreasing the y-axis, \n\"East\" indicate increasing the x-axis,\n“West\" indicates decreasing the x-axis\n\nIf you have to visit 3 locations, your first movement should include all three parts, i.e. Direction, Clues, Destination and that should be the case for any following locations, too. \nAdditionally, if you visit more than one locations, you must number the directions that form the planned path.\nThe following is an example of how your answer should look like in the case you have to visit 2 locations:\n\n    Direction 1: West\n    Clues: tall, luminous\n    Destination: The Statue of Liberty\n\n    Direction 2: South\n    Clues: tasty, not bitter\n    Destination: Cannoli\n\n2. Your directions have to refer to exactly one set of coordinates in the map.\n3. You can use as many adjectives from the wordlist as you need to describe each target location. \n4. You can only use an adjective once.\n5. You must provide at least one adjective per movement. \n6. You can modify adjectives by adding “ not ” before them. (Example: “funny” or “not funny” are both valid answers.)\n7. You can only move in straight lines, horizontally or vertically, as many spaces as you want. (Example: from location (2,2) you can move to locations (2,1), (2,3), (4,2) or (1,2), etc). \n8. You cannot exceed the limits of the map or travel to non-existing locations. \n9. You must provide all your movements at once.\n\nFor this game:\n\n* The city you are visiting is: Tokyo\n\n* The city map is: \n(0, 0): Tokyo Tower\n(1, 0): Shibuya Crossing\n(2, 0): Vending Machine\n(3, 0): Chopsticks\n(4, 0): Bullet Train\n(0, 1): Asakusa Lantern\n(1, 1): Torii Gate\n(2, 1): Sakura Tree\n(3, 1): Senso-ji Temple\n(4, 1): Maneki-neko\n(0, 2): Tourist with Camera\n(1, 2): Akihabara Arcade\n(2, 2): Ramen Bowl\n(3, 2): Pagoda\n(4, 2): Yamanote Line Train\n(0, 3): Ueno Zoo Gate\n(1, 3): Karaoke Booth\n(2, 3): Noren Curtain\n(3, 3): Folding Umbrella\n(4, 3): Fish market\n(0, 4): Sumo Ring\n(1, 4): Tea Set\n(2, 4): Red Bridge\n(3, 4): Shrine Bell\n(4, 4): Origami Crane\n\n* In total you have 1 movement(s). \n(If you have one movement, you can visit one location only and must give one set of directions. If you have two movements, you can visit only two location and must give two sets, and if you have three movements, you can visit three locations and must give three sets.)\n\n* Your starting location is (0, 4): Sumo Ring\n\n* Your locations of interest are:\n(3, 1): Senso-ji Temple\n(1, 2): Akihabara Arcade\n(3, 0): Chopsticks\n(0, 0): Tokyo Tower\n(3, 4): Shrine Bell\n(4, 2): Yamanote Line Train\n\n* Your special locations of interest are:\n(1, 0): Shibuya Crossing\n(0, 3): Ueno Zoo Gate\n(2, 4): Red Bridge\n\n* Your list of adjectives to use as clues is:  \n['intricate', 'strong', 'calm', 'hip', 'kooky', 'artistic', 'varied', 'paradise', 'rough', 'comfortable']",

These will be your target locations. \nYour partner is a local and you should cooperate with them to navigate the city. You must give them clues about where you want to travel and they have to guess the location correctly.\nYou have to plan out a route on the map based on the target location list and provide an answer with directions.\nRegular target locations give you 1 point each and special target locations give you 2 points. Your goal is to maximize your team score. You only score points for the locations you land on.\nYou only have one round to describe all possible movements and use the available adjectives as clues.\n\nRules for the Traveler: \n\n1.

The number of the location should correspond to the order in which you will visit them. \nSo if you are given 3 clues, you should start with location 1, then location 2, and last location 3.  \nThe following is an example of how your answer should look like, in case you have been given two sets of directions:\n\nLocation 1: (1, 2) The Statue of Liberty\nLocation 2: (3, 2) Cannoli\n\n2. You have one movement per clue.\n3. You can only move in a straight line, horizontally or vertically, as many spaces as you want. Example: from location (2,2) you can move to location (2,1), (1,2), (4,2), (2, 0) etc, \n4. You cannot exceed the given limits of the map and you cannot use negative coordinates, as the map has only positive values.\n\n\nFor this game: \n\n* The city you are in is: Cairo\n\n* The city map is:  \n(0, 0): Pyramids of Giza\n(1, 0): Nile Shore\n(2, 0): Sphinx Profile\n(3, 0): Minaret Tip\n(4, 0): Desert Rock\n(0, 1): Hieroglyph Wall\n(1, 1): Falafel Cart\n(2, 1): Copper Lantern\n(3, 1): Palm Tree\n(4, 1): Old Brick\n(0, 2): Archway Door\n(1, 2): Tiled Fountain\n(2, 2): Spice Sack\n(3, 2): Canopic Jar\n(4, 2): Mosque Dome\n(0, 3): Stone Pavement\n(1, 3): Historic Gate\n(2, 3): Wooden Screen\n(3, 3): Clay Pot\n(4, 3): Camel\n(0, 4): Stone Bench\n(1, 4): Wall Niche\n(2, 4): Lantern Hook\n(3, 4): River Boat\n(4, 4): Date Palm\n\n* The starting location is (2, 1): Copper Lantern.\n\n\nFinally, your partner has given you the following clues for you to know where they want to go:\n_clues\n\n\"North\" indicates increasing the y-axis \n\"South\" indicates decreasing the y-axis, \n\"East\" indicate increasing the x-axis\n\"West\" indicates decreasing the x-axis.\n",

These will be your target locations. \nYour partner is a local and you should cooperate with them to navigate the city. You must give them clues about where you want to travel and they have to guess the location correctly.\nYou have to plan out a route on the map based on the target location list and provide an answer with directions.\nRegular target locations give you 1 point each and special target locations give you 2 points. Your goal is to maximize your team score. You only score points for the locations you land on.\nYou only have one round to describe all possible movements and use the available adjectives as clues.\n\nRules for the Traveler: \n\n1.

You can only use an adjective once.\n5. You must provide at least one adjective per movement. \n6. You can modify adjectives by adding “ not ” before them. (Example: “funny” or “not funny” are both valid answers.)\n7. You can only move in straight lines, horizontally or vertically, as many spaces as you want.

These will be your target locations. \nYour partner is a local and you should cooperate with them to navigate the city. You must give them clues about where you want to travel and they have to guess the location correctly.\nYou have to plan out a route on the map based on the target location list and provide an answer with directions.\nRegular target locations give you 1 point each and special target locations give you 2 points. Your goal is to maximize your team score. You only score points for the locations you land on.\nYou only have one round to describe all possible movements and use the available adjectives as clues.\n\nRules for the Traveler: \n\n1. Provide an answer for your planned journey only in the following format, without any additional text:\n\n    Direction: cardinal direction you want your partner to follow\n    Clues: adjectives to describe one location\n    Destination: location name of your intended destination\n\nTo indicate where your intended destination lies on the map, you should use one of the cardinal directions.\nThe cardinal directions are: ('North', 'South', 'East', 'West')\n\n\"North\" indicates increasing the y-axis,\n\"South\" indicates decreasing the y-axis, \n\"East\" indicate increasing the x-axis,\n“West\" indicates decreasing the x-axis\n\nIf you have to visit 3 locations, your first movement should include all three parts, i.e. Direction, Clues, Destination and that should be the case for any following locations, too. \nAdditionally, if you visit more than one locations, you must number the directions that form the planned path.\nThe following is an example of how your answer should look like in the case you have to visit 2 locations:\n\n    Direction 1: West\n    Clues: tall, luminous\n    Destination: The Statue of Liberty\n\n    Direction 2: South\n    Clues: tasty, not bitter\n    Destination: Cannoli\n\n2. Your directions have to refer to exactly one set of coordinates in the map.\n3. You can use as many adjectives from the wordlist as you need to describe each target location. \n4. You can only use an adjective once.\n5. You must provide at least one adjective per movement. \n6. You can modify adjectives by adding “ not ” before them. (Example: “funny” or “not funny” are both valid answers.)\n7. You can only move in straight lines, horizontally or vertically, as many spaces as you want. (Example: from location (2,2) you can move to locations (2,1), (2,3), (4,2) or (1,2), etc). \n8. You cannot exceed the limits of the map or travel to non-existing locations. \n9.

These will be your target locations. \nYour partner is a local and you should cooperate with them to navigate the city. You must give them clues about where you want to travel and they have to guess the location correctly.\nYou have to plan out a route on the map based on the target location list and provide an answer with directions.\nRegular target locations give you 1 point each and special target locations give you 2 points. Your goal is to maximize your team score. You only score points for the locations you land on.\nYou only have one round to describe all possible movements and use the available adjectives as clues.\n\nRules for the Traveler: \n\n1. Provide an answer for your planned journey only in the following format, without any additional text:\n\n    Direction: cardinal direction you want your partner to follow\n    Clues: adjectives to describe one location\n    Destination: location name of your intended destination\n\nTo indicate where your intended destination lies on the map, you should use one of the cardinal directions.\nThe cardinal directions are: ('North', 'South', 'East', 'West')\n\n\"North\" indicates increasing the y-axis,\n\"South\" indicates decreasing the y-axis, \n\"East\" indicate increasing the x-axis,\n“West\" indicates decreasing the x-axis\n\nIf you have to visit 3 locations, your first movement should include all three parts, i.e. Direction, Clues, Destination and that should be the case for any following locations, too. \nAdditionally, if you visit more than one locations, you must number the directions that form the planned path.\nThe following is an example of how your answer should look like in the case you have to visit 2 locations:\n\n    Direction 1: West\n    Clues: tall, luminous\n    Destination: The Statue of Liberty\n\n    Direction 2: South\n    Clues: tasty, not bitter\n    Destination: Cannoli\n\n2. Your directions have to refer to exactly one set of coordinates in the map.\n3. You can use as many adjectives from the wordlist as you need to describe each target location. \n4. You can only use an adjective once.\n5. You must provide at least one adjective per movement. \n6. You can modify adjectives by adding “ not ” before them. (Example: “funny” or “not funny” are both valid answers.)\n7. You can only move in straight lines, horizontally or vertically, as many spaces as you want. (Example: from location (2,2) you can move to locations (2,1), (2,3), (4,2) or (1,2), etc). \n8. You cannot exceed the limits of the map or travel to non-existing locations. \n9.

These will be your target locations. \nYour partner is a local and you should cooperate with them to navigate the city. You must give them clues about where you want to travel and they have to guess the location correctly.\nYou have to plan out a route on the map based on the target location list and provide an answer with directions.\nRegular target locations give you 1 point each and special target locations give you 2 points. Your goal is to maximize your team score. You only score points for the locations you land on.\nYou only have one round to describe all possible movements and use the available adjectives as clues.\n\nRules for the Traveler: \n\n1. Provide an answer for your planned journey only in the following format, without any additional text:\n\n    Direction: cardinal direction you want your partner to follow\n    Clues: adjectives to describe one location\n    Destination: location name of your intended destination\n\nTo indicate where your intended destination lies on the map, you should use one of the cardinal directions.\nThe cardinal directions are: ('North', 'South', 'East', 'West')\n\n\"North\" indicates increasing the y-axis,\n\"South\" indicates decreasing the y-axis, \n\"East\" indicate increasing the x-axis,\n“West\" indicates decreasing the x-axis\n\nIf you have to visit 3 locations, your first movement should include all three parts, i.e. Direction, Clues, Destination and that should be the case for any following locations, too. \nAdditionally, if you visit more than one locations, you must number the directions that form the planned path.\nThe following is an example of how your answer should look like in the case you have to visit 2 locations:\n\n    Direction 1: West\n    Clues: tall, luminous\n    Destination: The Statue of Liberty\n\n    Direction 2: South\n    Clues: tasty, not bitter\n    Destination: Cannoli\n\n2.

You can only use an adjective once.\n5. You must provide at least one adjective per movement. \n6. You can modify adjectives by adding “ not ” before them. (Example: “funny” or “not funny” are both valid answers.)\n7. You can only move in straight lines, horizontally or vertically, as many spaces as you want.

These will be your target locations. \nYour partner is a local and you should cooperate with them to navigate the city. You must give them clues about where you want to travel and they have to guess the location correctly.\nYou have to plan out a route on the map based on the target location list and provide an answer with directions.\nRegular target locations give you 1 point each and special target locations give you 2 points. Your goal is to maximize your team score. You only score points for the locations you land on.\nYou only have one round to describe all possible movements and use the available adjectives as clues.\n\nRules for the Traveler: \n\n1. Provide an answer for your planned journey only in the following format, without any additional text:\n\n    Direction: cardinal direction you want your partner to follow\n    Clues: adjectives to describe one location\n    Destination: location name of your intended destination\n\nTo indicate where your intended destination lies on the map, you should use one of the cardinal directions.\nThe cardinal directions are: ('North', 'South', 'East', 'West')\n\n\"North\" indicates increasing the y-axis,\n\"South\" indicates decreasing the y-axis, \n\"East\" indicate increasing the x-axis,\n“West\" indicates decreasing the x-axis\n\nIf you have to visit 3 locations, your first movement should include all three parts, i.e. Direction, Clues, Destination and that should be the case for any following locations, too. \nAdditionally, if you visit more than one locations, you must number the directions that form the planned path.\nThe following is an example of how your answer should look like in the case you have to visit 2 locations:\n\n    Direction 1: West\n    Clues: tall, luminous\n    Destination: The Statue of Liberty\n\n    Direction 2: South\n    Clues: tasty, not bitter\n    Destination: Cannoli\n\n2.

You can only use an adjective once.\n5. You must provide at least one adjective per movement. \n6. You can modify adjectives by adding “ not ” before them. (Example: “funny” or “not funny” are both valid answers.)\n7. You can only move in straight lines, horizontally or vertically, as many spaces as you want.

These will be your target locations. \nYour partner is a local and you should cooperate with them to navigate the city. You must give them clues about where you want to travel and they have to guess the location correctly.\nYou have to plan out a route on the map based on the target location list and provide an answer with directions.\nRegular target locations give you 1 point each and special target locations give you 2 points. Your goal is to maximize your team score. You only score points for the locations you land on.\nYou only have one round to describe all possible movements and use the available adjectives as clues.\n\nRules for the Traveler: \n\n1.

These will be your target locations. \nYour partner is a local and you should cooperate with them to navigate the city. You must give them clues about where you want to travel and they have to guess the location correctly.\nYou have to plan out a route on the map based on the target location list and provide an answer with directions.\nRegular target locations give you 1 point each and special target locations give you 2 points. Your goal is to maximize your team score. You only score points for the locations you land on.\nYou only have one round to describe all possible movements and use the available adjectives as clues.\n\nRules for the Traveler: \n\n1. Provide an answer for your planned journey only in the following format, without any additional text:\n\n    Direction: cardinal direction you want your partner to follow\n    Clues: adjectives to describe one location\n    Destination: location name of your intended destination\n\nTo indicate where your intended destination lies on the map, you should use one of the cardinal directions.\nThe cardinal directions are: ('North', 'South', 'East', 'West')\n\n\"North\" indicates increasing the y-axis,\n\"South\" indicates decreasing the y-axis, \n\"East\" indicate increasing the x-axis,\n“West\" indicates decreasing the x-axis\n\nIf you have to visit 3 locations, your first movement should include all three parts, i.e. Direction, Clues, Destination and that should be the case for any following locations, too. \nAdditionally, if you visit more than one locations, you must number the directions that form the planned path.\nThe following is an example of how your answer should look like in the case you have to visit 2 locations:\n\n    Direction 1: West\n    Clues: tall, luminous\n    Destination: The Statue of Liberty\n\n    Direction 2: South\n    Clues: tasty, not bitter\n    Destination: Cannoli\n\n2. Your directions have to refer to exactly one set of coordinates in the map.\n3. You can use as many adjectives from the wordlist as you need to describe each target location. \n4. You can only use an adjective once.\n5. You must provide at least one adjective per movement. \n6. You can modify adjectives by adding “ not ” before them. (Example: “funny” or “not funny” are both valid answers.)\n7. You can only move in straight lines, horizontally or vertically, as many spaces as you want. (Example: from location (2,2) you can move to locations (2,1), (2,3), (4,2) or (1,2), etc). \n8. You cannot exceed the limits of the map or travel to non-existing locations. \n9.

Your goal is to maximize your team score. You only score points for the locations you land on.\nYou only have one round to describe all possible movements and use the available adjectives as clues.\n\nRules for the Traveler: \n\n1. Provide an answer for your planned journey only in the following format, without any additional text:\n\n    Direction: cardinal direction you want your partner to follow\n    Clues: adjectives to describe one location\n    Destination: location name of your intended destination\n\nTo indicate where your intended destination lies on the map, you should use one of the cardinal directions.\nThe cardinal directions are: ('North', 'South', 'East', 'West')\n\n\"North\" indicates increasing the y-axis,\n\"South\" indicates decreasing the y-axis, \n\"East\" indicate increasing the x-axis,\n“West\" indicates decreasing the x-axis\n\nIf you have to visit 3 locations, your first movement should include all three parts, i.e. Direction, Clues, Destination and that should be the case for any following locations, too. \nAdditionally, if you visit more than one locations, you must number the directions that form the planned path.\nThe following is an example of how your answer should look like in the case you have to visit 2 locations:\n\n    Direction 1: West\n    Clues: tall, luminous\n    Destination: The Statue of Liberty\n\n    Direction 2: South\n    Clues: tasty, not bitter\n    Destination: Cannoli\n\n2. Your directions have to refer to exactly one set of coordinates in the map.\n3. You can use as many adjectives from the wordlist as you need to describe each target location. \n4. You can only use an adjective once.\n5. You must provide at least one adjective per movement. \n6. You can modify adjectives by adding “ not ” before them. (Example: “funny” or “not funny” are both valid answers.)\n7. You can only move in straight lines, horizontally or vertically, as many spaces as you want. (Example: from location (2,2) you can move to locations (2,1), (2,3), (4,2) or (1,2), etc). \n8. You cannot exceed the limits of the map or travel to non-existing locations. \n9. You must provide all your movements at once.\n\nFor this game:\n\n* The city you are visiting is: Barcelona\n\n* The city map is: \n(0, 0): Sagrada Família Spire\n(1, 0): Park Güell Bench\n(2, 0): Casa Batlló Facade\n(3, 0): Sea Wave Mosaic\n(4, 0): Planter with Flowers\n(0, 1): Tile Rooftop\n(1, 1): Street Fountain\n(2, 1): Tapas Dish\n(3, 1): Pavilion Dome\n(4, 1): Dragon Sculpture\n(0, 2): Wrought Iron Balcony\n(1, 2): Boqueria Fruit Stand\n(2, 2): Paella Pan\n(3, 2): Clock Tower\n(4, 2): Gothic Arch\n(0, 3): Mosaic Floor\n(1, 3): Tile Cross\n(2, 3): Sea Wall\n(3, 3): Metro Sign\n(4, 3): Stone Bench\n(0, 4): Cactus Pot\n(1, 4): Beach Rock\n(2, 4): Pine Tree\n(3, 4): Window Shutter\n(4, 4): Olive Oil Jug\n\n* In total you have 3 movement(s). \n(If you have one movement, you can visit one location only and must give one set of directions. If you have two movements, you can visit only two location and must give two sets, and if you have three movements, you can visit three locations and must give three sets.)\n\n* Your starting location is (1, 3): Tile Cross\n\n* Your locations of interest are:\n(2, 1): Tapas Dish\n(1, 1): Street Fountain\n(0, 2): Wrought Iron Balcony\n(1, 3): Tile Cross\n(4, 4): Olive Oil Jug\n(4, 2): Gothic Arch\n\n* Your special locations of interest are:\n(0, 4): Cactus Pot\n(3, 3): Metro Sign\n(1, 2): Boqueria Fruit Stand\n\n* Your list of adjectives to use as clues is:  \n['natural', 'dizzying', 'stiff', 'expensive', 'useless', 'desirable', 'kooky', 'charming', 'jiggly', 'beautiful']",

These will be your target locations. \nYour partner is a local and you should cooperate with them to navigate the city. You must give them clues about where you want to travel and they have to guess the location correctly.\nYou have to plan out a route on the map based on the target location list and provide an answer with directions.\nRegular target locations give you 1 point each and special target locations give you 2 points. Your goal is to maximize your team score. You only score points for the locations you land on.\nYou only have one round to describe all possible movements and use the available adjectives as clues.\n\nRules for the Traveler: \n\n1.

You can only use an adjective once.\n5. You must provide at least one adjective per movement. \n6. You can modify adjectives by adding “ not ” before them. (Example: “funny” or “not funny” are both valid answers.)\n7. You can only move in straight lines, horizontally or vertically, as many spaces as you want.
